AI Academic Agent Chatbot

An AI-powered academic assistant designed for our IT course, specializing in Web and Mobile Application Development.

This chatbot is trained on all our subjects, lecture materials, and PDF learning modules (SLMs). It can answer academic questions, explain concepts, and provide guidance based on our current school discussions and resources.

The main goal is to make academic support accessible even without mobile data load â€” students can message the page for free and get instant responses to their IT-related queries.
